# Character Design: From Sketch to Superhero

![Character Design Process](/assets/images/character-design.jpg)

Creating memorable characters is one of the most important aspects of comic creation. Today, I'll share my process for bringing characters to life.

## Step 1: Concept Development

Every great character starts with a strong concept:

- Personality traits
- Backstory
- Motivations
- Unique features

## Step 2: Visual Design

The visual design should reflect the character's personality:

- Silhouette
- Color scheme
- Costume design
- Facial expressions

## Step 3: Refinement

This is where the magic happens:

- Multiple iterations
- Feedback from peers
- Testing in different poses
- Final polish

## Pro Tips

Here are some of my favorite character design tips:

1. Start with simple shapes
2. Exaggerate key features
3. Make them instantly recognizable
4. Consider how they'll look in different poses

Remember, great characters are more than just their appearance - they need personality, depth, and a story to tell!
